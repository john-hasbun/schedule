Overview
========

This web application and its scripts help TheCAT keep track of who should be
on duty and when.

The web app allows volunteers to set when they are available to be scheduled,
view the overall schedule, drop their shifts, and pick up dropped shifts.

Deskbot is an irc bot that responds to commands to say who is currently
scheduled, when a person is next scheduled, and to translate between someone's
handle and username.

The scripts help in administrating the schedule, as much of the back end
functionality is not contained in the web app.
